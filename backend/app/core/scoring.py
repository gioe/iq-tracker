IQ Score Calculation Module.

This module provides scoring algorithms for converting test performance
into IQ scores. The architecture is designed to be pluggable, allowing
easy swapping of scoring strategies.

TODO: Research Plan for Real-World IQ Scoring
==============================================
We need to develop a comprehensive research plan to understand how IQ tests
are scored in the real world. This should include:

1. **Standardized Test Research:**
   - Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)
   - Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales
   - Raven's Progressive Matrices
   - How do these tests normalize scores across populations?

2. **Statistical Methods:**
   - Standard deviation and z-score normalization
   - Age-based norm groups
   - Percentile rank conversion
   - Item Response Theory (IRT) vs Classical Test Theory (CTT)

3. **Question Weighting:**
   - How are questions weighted by difficulty?
   - Adaptive testing algorithms (CAT - Computer Adaptive Testing)
   - Impact of question type (spatial, verbal, logic, etc.) on overall IQ

4. **Validation:**
   - Test-retest reliability
   - Correlation with other validated IQ tests
   - Population-based calibration requirements

5. **Ethical Considerations:**
   - Cultural bias in IQ testing
   - Flynn effect (IQ score inflation over time)
   - Appropriate use of IQ scores

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Literature review of modern IQ testing methodologies
- [ ] Consult with psychometrician or educational psychologist
- [ ] Gather sample data to validate our scoring approach
- [ ] Consider implementing multiple scoring models and A/B testing

**Current Status:** Using simplified Standard IQ Range algorithm (MVP)
**Priority:** Medium (post-MVP research task)

    more sophisticated normalization based on population data, age groups,
