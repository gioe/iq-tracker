# Arbiter Model Configuration
# Maps question types to specific arbiter models for quality evaluation
#
# Each question type can be evaluated by a different model based on
# benchmark performance and domain expertise.
#
# Configuration Structure:
#   question_type:
#     model: Model identifier (e.g., "gpt-4", "claude-sonnet-4-5")
#     provider: Provider name ("openai", "anthropic", "google", "xai")
#     rationale: Explanation of why this model was chosen
#     enabled: Whether this arbiter is active (default: true)

  verbal_reasoning:
    model: "claude-sonnet-4-5"
    provider: "anthropic"
    rationale: "Exceptional language understanding: MMLU (90.4%), strong performance on HellaSwag and WinoGrande. Claude 3.5 Sonnet leads in natural language reasoning and comprehension tasks."
    benchmark_data:
      MMLU: "90.4%"
      HellaSwag: "~90%"
    enabled: true

  memory:
    model: "claude-sonnet-4-5"
    provider: "anthropic"
    rationale: "Outstanding recall and knowledge retention: MMLU (90.4%) with 200K token context window. Claude 3.5 Sonnet combines strong knowledge benchmarks with massive context for memory-intensive evaluation."

# Evaluation criteria weights (0.0 to 1.0)
# These determine how heavily each factor is weighted in the arbiter score
evaluation_criteria:
  clarity: 0.25              # Question is clear and unambiguous
  difficulty: 0.20           # Appropriate difficulty for IQ testing
  validity: 0.30             # Valid as an IQ test question
  formatting: 0.15           # Properly formatted with correct answer
  creativity: 0.10           # Novel and interesting question

# Minimum score threshold for question approval (0.0 to 1.0)
min_arbiter_score: 0.7

# Notes:
# - Model identifiers should match the exact model names used by provider SDKs
# - Provider names must match: "openai", "anthropic", "google", or "xai"
# - Enabled flag can be used to temporarily disable specific arbiters
# - Evaluation criteria weights should sum to 1.0
